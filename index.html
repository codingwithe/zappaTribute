        <em>Frank Vincent Zappa</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
        <b>(December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993)</b> 
        was an American musician, composer, activist and filmmaker. 
        His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, 
        sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture. 
        In a career spanning more than <i>30 years</i>, Zappa composed rock, 
        pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral and musique concrète works, and produced 
        almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band 
        the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. 
        Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, 
        and designed album covers. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse 
            rock musicians of his era.<br><br>
